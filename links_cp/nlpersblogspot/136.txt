 I couldn't find a schedule for ICML that had paper titles/authors written in, so I joined the existing schedule with the abstracts to create a printable schedule with titles. You can find organizer-created schedules for UAI and COLT already. In addition, I've put ICML 2009 up on WhatToSee, so have fun! (I haven't done UAI and/or COLT because their papers haven't appeared online yet.)

 This is such a great resource that you are providing and you give it away for free. I love seeing websites that understand the value of providing a quality resource for free. It’s the old what goes around comes around routine. 
 There are certainly a lot of details like that to take into consideration. That’s a great point to bring up. I offer the thoughts above as general inspiration but clearly there are questions like the one you bring up where the most important thing will be working in honest good faith.
