Highlights of 2013 
 2013 has been an outstanding year for me personally. Among other things, there have been 2 key highlights for this year: 
 Becoming a father to the cutest baby (Jenika) in this world; and 
 Starting up and running Analytics Vidhya 
 While there is no comparison between the 2, there have been times when I felt that I am raising 2 babies simultaneously. I still remember sitting along side baby incubator (while Jenika was being treated for Jaundice) and scrambling my notes @ 3:00 a.m. in morning to make sure that a post goes out next day. 
 So while I was creating a collage of Jenikaâ€™s photos from 2013, I thought it might be a good idea to quickly reflect on 2013 for Analytics Vidhya and bring out some of the highlights. 
 Here is what we achieved in 2013: 
 In the first 8 months of existence, Analytics Vidhya was visited by more than 20,000 unique visitors who made more than 33,000 visits to the blog. 
 We have published a total of 51 posts till date and are still counting 
 Our monthly visits has been consistently growing (except for the month when I took ~15 day break and Jenika was born). 
 I can go on and onâ€¦.but you get the idea! We are one of the most read blogs in India in Analytics domain. 
 To summarize, the journey has been extremely fulfilling for me personally and every one involved in creation of Analytics Vidhya. We hope that we have created a difference in life of several analysts and the larger analytics community.
