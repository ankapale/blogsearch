 Big data is new and exciting, but there are still lots of small data problems in the world. Many people who are just becoming aware that they need to work with data are finding that they lack the tools to do so.

But some of our readers have perfectly validly pointed out that this may be too narrow a view.

Steve's post is an excellent example of this, and we are thrilled to see him contribute this month's article.
