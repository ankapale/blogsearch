Legal Innovators Conference 
 Welcome to the inaugural Legal Innovators, a conference created by Artificial Lawyer and organised by Cosmonauts Ltd for all of you working at the intersection of technology and the business of law. First and foremost, Legal Innovators is a conference by and for the professionals who are making change a reality. 
 It’s for everyone who wants to share insights and explore practical challenges such as: 
 • How do you build and run an effective innovation team?
• How do you get value out of AI systems?
• How can we use automation to improve workflows and harness legal data?
• What are the opportunities for legal ops?
• And, what problems do the clients really want to solve with technology? 
 Legal Innovators is about the real-life experiences of the people working at the cutting edge of solving their firm’s and their clients’ challenges through innovation. The latest legal technology, such as AI and automation, is a central part of this. But, people and process are vital too, and this conference will be focused on all three pillars of legal innovation.
