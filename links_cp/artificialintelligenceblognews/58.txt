Nov 30 AI is the Next Step in Human Evolution 
 Until now, our evolution was biological. We’ve developed additional layers of the brain, upright posture, and other physical attributes to adapt to our ever-changing lifestyle. However, we’ve reached a point in time where our biological evolution can’t keep up with the pace of change. 
 Look how far humanity has come. What an elaborate and complex world we have built. A world, in fact, that’s far more complex than our brains can handle. 
 The upcoming paradigm shift is not just a technological revolution. It’s an evolutional revolution. It’s the biggest shift in human evolution since the dawn of time that will change who we are as a species for good. 
 AI will not replace humans, nor will it compete with us. Instead, we will utilize and integrate it into our cognition. Our evolution will shift from biological to technological if you will. It’s not the computer that becomes super intelligent. It’s the human who becomes super intelligent.
