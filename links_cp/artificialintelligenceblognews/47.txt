Apr 9 Tesla's New Autopilot Software is Massively Improved 
 We found a great video of Tesla's updated "autopilot" software which gives Tesla (founded by Elon Musk) electric cars (in this case a Model S) quite impressive self-driving capabilities. It is worth noting that this software is not supposed to be used without close oversight and control of the driver. 
 The road this test-drive happened on is the "HÃ¶henstrasse" in the hills west of Vienna, a very scenic route, but likely a good challenge for the software as the cobblestone road is very windy (as in: it has a lot of turns - not wind #wink) and mostly has no road markings. 
 Elon Musk's company is doing a stellar job at developing and improving their cars; self driving vapabilities.
