Jan 24 What's Bigger than Fire and Electricity? 
 Google CEO Sundar Pichai believes artificial intelligence could have “more profound” implications for humanity than electricity or fire, according to recent comments. 
 Pichai also warned that the development of artificial intelligence could pose as much risk as that of fire if its potential is not harnessed correctly. 
 AI is one of the most important things humanity is working on, It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire. 
 — Sundar Pichai, Google CEO 
 Pichai went on to warn of the potential dangers associated with developing advanced AI, saying that developers need to learn to harness its benefits in the same way humans did with fire. 
 Google has invested heavily in artificial intelligence research, having acquired the London-based startup DeepMind for £300 million in 2014. 
 DeepMind is often cited by AI experts and academics as the leading pioneer in AI research for its work in developing an algorithm capable of beating human champions at the ancient board game Go, as well as its work with the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.
