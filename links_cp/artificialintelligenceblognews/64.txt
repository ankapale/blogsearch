Google's artificial intelligence company, DeepMind, has developed an AI that has managed to learn how to walk, run, jump, and climb without any prior guidance. The result is as impressive as it is goofy.

 But what is really going on here is highly impressive! 
 DeepMind writes: "True motor intelligence requires learning how to control and coordinate a flexible body to solve tasks in a range of complex environments. Existing attempts to control physically simulated humanoid bodies come from diverse fields, including computer animation and biomechanics. A trend has been to use hand-crafted objectives, sometimes with motion capture data, to produce specific behaviors. However, this may require considerable engineering effort, and can result in restricted behaviours or behaviours that may be difficult to repurpose for new tasks." 
 Achieving flexible and adaptive control of simulated bodies is a key element of AI research. Our work aims to develop flexible systems which learn and adapt skills to solve motor control tasks while reducing the manual engineering required to achieve this goal. Future work could extend these approaches to enable coordination of a greater range of behaviours in more complex situations. 

 The agility and flexibility of a monkey swinging through the trees or a football player dodging opponents and scoring a goal can be breathtaking. Mastering this kind of sophisticated motor control is a hallmark of physical intelligence, and is a crucial part of AI research.
