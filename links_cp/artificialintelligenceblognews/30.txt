Apr 10 Is Machine Learning Right for You? 
 Are you considering using machine learning? First, you have to think about the problem you are trying to solve. 
 Speaking at the recent Code PaLOUsa conference in Louisville, Brian Korzynski, a senior application developer at United Shore, explained why it's essential that businesses understand the pros and cons of machine learning. 
 At Code PaLOUsa 2018, Brian Korzynski of United Shore explained why companies need to understand what machine learning truly is and what kind of problems it can solve before diving in. 
 There’s been a lot of buzz in the news about what machining learning is and what it’s not, and there’s a lot of misconceptions that people get about what it really is. What it really is is a very specific set of algorithms that solve very specific problems. Machine learning is only targeted towards certain types of problems such as classifications, or regressions, recommendations, those kinds of things. 
 The subset is a lot smaller than what a lot of people think, but a lot of it gets misconstrued, based upon a lot of the things you see in the news, such as like self-driving cars, and how machines are generating scripts for movies and things like that.
