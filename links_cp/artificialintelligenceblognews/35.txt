Feb 20 Interview with iOlite CEO Alfred Shaffir 
 Following up on the article I wrote a few days ago I was fortunate enough to spend some time with iOlite CEO and co-founder Alfred Shaffir to talk more about iOlite's platform that combines AI (machine learning), the blockchain and most importantly a community of experts. 
 iOlite finally makes your dreams come true with an AI that can take any input and write software for you. iOlite is supported by a rapidly growing community of developers that keep enhancing and improving the AI. 
 Hi Alfred, thank you for taking the time to answer some questions about iOlite today. First, can you please give us a brief introduction to who you are, maybe some background information, and what your role in iOlite is?
