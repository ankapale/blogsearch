Jan 30 Elon Musk is Preparing to Release "Brain Hacking Tech" 
 The age of the machine is well underway, and there is a very good chance that humanity will be left behind. Artificial intelligence is beating us at poker. It is beating us at Go. It is saving lives by identifying diseases when human doctors fail. It is running our grocery stores. It is driving our cars. AI is even making other AI. 
 Soon, very soon, our computers will surpass us in every skill imaginable. 
 This fact concerns a number of individuals, as artificial intelligence is predicted to outpace humanity at an unprecedented rate, which may result in AI looking at us as nothing more than house pets (or maybe even doing away with us entirely). 
 This fear has pushed Elon Musk to suggest something rather unconventional and almost controversial: the neural lace. In short, the neural lace is a device that is intended to grow with your brain. Its primary purpose is to optimize mental output through a brain-computer interface, allowing the human brain to effortlessly access the internet and, thus, keep up with (and someday merge with) artificially intelligent systems. 
 Musk asserts that the neural lace could push our cognitive performance to levels that are comparable to that of AI. He has teased updates before, and now, we may finally be getting something solid. 
 Elon Musk stated that updates regarding his neural lace, which is meant to augment the human mind, are coming next month. In October, Bryan Johnson announced a $100 million investment to put computers in our brains. And so, a race is on to hack human intelligence.
