Apr 11 Tesla Full Self-Driving Images Leaked 
 Tesla’s full self-driving autonomous vehicle feature is coming. An image leaked on Tuesday apparently shows the new user interface of a test-car. The image shows how the autopilot software/system views and interprets the world. The view has strong similarities to previous autonomous driving videos released by Tesla, there is now an option called "full self-driving” indicating a more advanced mode suggesting complete autonomy of the car. 
 The new feature builds on Tesla's current autopilot through software updates, but this is still speculative. 
 ... [we are] pretty excited about how much progress we’re making on the neural net front ... [it will] feel like, ‘well this is a lame driver, lame driver, well actually this is a pretty good driver, like holy cow this driver’s good.’ 
 — Elon Musk

 It is unclear on when full autonomy will ship to the masses. Elon Musk said during a call in February that autonomy was around three to six months away, but he also said during a panel discussion at SXSW, last month that “self-driving will encompass all modes of driving by the end of the next year [2019].”
