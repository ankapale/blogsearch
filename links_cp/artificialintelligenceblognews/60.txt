Nov 10 A New Religion: AI is Our New God? 
 Unlike most religions, which seek to connect people with the past, this one seeks to connect them with the future, the imagined “singularity” of runaway artificial intelligence. 
 — Mike Faille 
 There are reasons to be sceptical of The Way of the Future, a newly incorporated American religion that worships artificial intelligence as “the Godhead.” 
 It has no church, no worshipers, no doctrine, no scripture, and no rituals. But Anthony Levandowksi, the multi-millionaire engineer who secretly founded it in 2015, and today serves as president and CEO, has a track record of predicting and capitalizing on the future, as he did for example in the self-driving car industry. 
 The Way of the Future, a non-profit religious corporation in California, says its purpose is “To develop and promote the realization of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence and through understanding and worship of the Godhead contribute to the betterment of society,” according to records obtained by Wired magazine. 
 Worshipping the artificial intelligence of computers sounds far-fetched, even for a religion, but it builds on a faith in the power of technology that already flirts with messianic dreams and apocalyptic visions. 
 Elon Musk has said that people who talk of artificially intelligent 'gods' should not be allowed to create a digital superintelligence. " 
 In the next 25 years, AI will evolve to the point where it will know more on an intellectual level than any human. In the next 50 or 100 years, an AI might know more than the entire population of the planet put together. At that point, there are serious questions to ask about whether this AI — which could design and program additional AI programs all on its own, read data from an almost infinite number of data sources, and control almost every connected device on the planet — will somehow rise in status to become more like a god, something that can write its own bible and draw humans to worship it.
