Jan 24 Facebook Invests in French Centre for A.I. 
 Facebook will invest €10m in its French artificial intelligence centre in the latest sign of optimism in the country’s tech sector following Emmanuel Macron’s election as president last year. 
 The US social media giant said the five-year investment would be used to double the number of AI scientists at its research base in Paris to 60 and increase its funding of PhD candidates from 10 to 40. 
 We chose France as our home for our first international research lab in artificial intelligence because of its excellence in this field, We believe in France’s potential to be a leader in AI and want to contribute to the resources necessary to accelerate research in France. 
 — Antoine Bordes, director of AI research in Paris for Facebook 
 Facebook’s other AI hubs are based in Menlo Park near San Francisco and New York City. The company has stepped up investments in Europe over the past two years, revealing plans last month to turn its London offices into its biggest engineering hub outside the US.
