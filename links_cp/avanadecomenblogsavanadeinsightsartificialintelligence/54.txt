Starting at the very beginning of the day, and continuing onwards, the venue hummed with energy as people had the opportunity to collaborate and discuss with their peers on the topic of RPA, and their own digital workforce. 
 It was great to see what the market was thinking, and the challenges that enterprise organizations are facing with this technology. Judging from the amazing turn out, clearly a lot of businesses have RPA on their agenda right now, and the lessons learnt on governance, security, and the many forms of change enablement seem key to bring the whole organization on the modernization journey. 
 I was also extremely proud to see Avanade announce our partnership with Blue Prism at the event. As the leading digital innovator, Avanade is helping organisations to transform their workplace, and empower the digital workforce of the future, with a real focus on governance and sustainability. 
 Graeme Hackland of Williams Martini Racing took the opportunity to speak at the conference, kicking off the customer track, and really setting the scene. The talk was so enthralling, spanning their wider digital transformation, the value Williams sees from RPA, and how Avanade is helping to deliver value across this space, to achieve increased productivity, and higher employee engagement.
