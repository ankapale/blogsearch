iCIMS Social Recruiting Platform; Recruit Using Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Many More 
 The iCIMS Recruit® coupled with iCIMS Social Distribution® enables organizations to source, recruit, and hire the best talent through social networks with enhanced employee referral campaigns and automated job publishing. Is your organization currently leveraging social recruitment? Here are four reasons they should: 
 89% of companies used Social Media Networks for Recruiting in 2011 
 14.4 million people used social media to find their last job in 2011 
 1 of 5 employers use social networking sites to research job candidates 
 55% of companies plan to invest more in social recruiting in the next year 
 With your expanded social presence on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, its easier than ever to attract top talent to your organization and instantly be connected to hundreds of new, quality candidates, including passive candidates. Employee referrals are maximized, cost-per-hire dramatically decreases, and recruiters are ensured massive reach with unlimited postings. Reinforce your employment brand by featuring career videos and links to all corporate social media networks. Ultimately, your organization will benefit from better quality of hire! 
 Traditionally, recruiters solely relied on employees to make referrals and used other means to source potential candidates. Now, with iCIMSSocial Distributionthe two are synergistically blended together. Recruiters can see which employees have connections that match the skills and background theyre looking for, and can proactively invite employees to refer their connections to open positions. 
 In this recorded webinar, Jindrich Liska (Senior Director of Social Distribution at iCIMS) will lead viewers through how recruiters can leverage iCIMS Social Distribution for referral hiring and candidate sourcing.
