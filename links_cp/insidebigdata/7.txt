BAE Systems 
 We help nations, governments and businesses around the world defend themselves against cyber crime, reduce their risk in the connected world, comply with regulation, and transform their operations.
We do this using our unique set of solutions, systems, experience and processes, often collecting and analyzing huge volumes of data. These, combined with our Cyber Special Forces  some of the most skilled people in the world  enable us to defend against cyber attacks, fraud, and financial crime; enable intelligence-led policing; and solve complex data problems.
We employ over 4,000 people across 18 countries in the Americas, APAC, UK and EMEA.
