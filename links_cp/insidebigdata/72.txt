InMage 
 Business relies on consistent, reliable and available data. InMage was founded to improve upon previous business continuity measures that relied on decades-old approaches. Our mission is to ensure that business-critical data is always available, locally and/or at remote sites, in a cost-effective, scalable, non-disruptive and future-proof manner.
