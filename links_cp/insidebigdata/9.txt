Over the past few years, new IT infrastructure options for enterprise transactional applications have arisen thanks to numerous improvements in storage processing power and the robustness of networking protocols. SAN protocols are no longer the only option for IT storage administrations. VMware, Hyper-V, SQL, and even SAP and Oracle deployments have taken advantage of the benefits offered by NFS, and more recently SMB 3, network-attached storage (NAS) protocols. However, support for NAS protocols alone is not enough. EMC and Brocade understand that supporting enterprise applications requires delivering enterprise storage and networking capabilities to maximize resiliency and performance.
